-- DML Activity per SQL statement
-- SQL and Azure: SQL is for all DBs on instance. Azure is for DB context. (SQL: DBID is NULL for ad hoc and prepared SQL statements)
-- Feeds a graph to show normal data access in SQL by read and write statements
-- Unable to use query hash. It is not availible in SQL Server 2005.
-- creation_time tells you the date and time that the plan that the query is part of was compiled. The stats are all as of the plan and creation_time.
-- So, we need to track SQL statements in plans and add up the stats since compile time.
-- Encrypted SQL statements are ignored
-- We default to a Read when the statement is not categorized. (rare)
-- Use: 
	--plan_handle, SQLStatement and creation_time will give a unique item to calc delta. 
	--These stay in the result set until they un-cache. 
	--Un-cached items count as a 0 delta. 
	--Drop these from delta tracking list.
